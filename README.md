# Practical Data Science on the AWS Cloud Specialization

## Description

This repository is a collection of notes documenting the essential teachings in the [Practical Data Science on AWS Cloud Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/practical-data-science) on Coursera. It is an easy reference to come back to for review and includes experimental notebooks for exploration and better understading of the concepts.

## Studying Framework

A framework I find useful to learn content, especially in online courses, is the following:

1. __Essentials__: Take notes on the essential concepts and ideas.
2. __Explain__: Explain the concepts and ideas in your own words to an inanimate object (e.g. a rubber duck) to ensure you understand them.
3. __Consistent__: Nothing beats the exponential power of consistency.

In short: consistently explain the essentials. Anything else, such as applying what you learn by building projects, will come easier when the foundation is built with this framework - this is true for me at least.

## Structure of Specialization

1. [Analyze Datasets and Train ML Models using AutoML](https://www.coursera.org/learn/automl-datasets-ml-models?specialization=practical-data-science)
2. [Build, Train, and Deploy ML Pipelines using BERT](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-pipelines-bert?specialization=practical-data-science)
3. [Optimize ML Models and Deploy Human-in-the-Loop ML Pipelines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-models-human-in-the-loop-pipelines?specialization=practical-data-science)
