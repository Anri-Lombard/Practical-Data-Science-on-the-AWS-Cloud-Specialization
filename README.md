# Practical Data Science on the AWS Cloud Specialization

## Description

This repository is a collection of long-form notes to deepen understanding of concepts discussed in the [Practical Data Science on AWS Cloud Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/practical-data-science) on Coursera. The goal is to help bolster your understanding of the material and provide a reference for future use. Incomplete notebooks will also be provided for extra context, although self-completion is encouraged for the best learning experience.

## Structure of Specialization

1. [Analyze Datasets and Train ML Models using AutoML](https://www.coursera.org/learn/automl-datasets-ml-models?specialization=practical-data-science)
2. [Build, Train, and Deploy ML Pipelines using BERT](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-pipelines-bert?specialization=practical-data-science)
3. [Optimize ML Models and Deploy Human-in-the-Loop ML Pipelines](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-models-human-in-the-loop-pipelines?specialization=practical-data-science)
